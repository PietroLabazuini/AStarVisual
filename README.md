# AStarVisual
**[NOT FINISHED]** 
## Unity Development project where I implement a visual interface for an A* algorithm
This is only the visual part of the code. The algorithmic part was programmed by a company that gave me this project.
If you want to see this code in action, download Unity and create a new project, then add the Assets folder of this repos to the project folder.
